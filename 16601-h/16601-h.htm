<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The extreme rarity of <i>The Death-Wake</i> is a reason for its
republication, which may or may not be approved of by collectors. Of
the original edition the Author says that more than seventy copies
were sold in the first week of publication, but thereafter the
publisher failed in business. Mr. Stoddart recovered the sheets of his
poem, and his cook gradually, and perhaps not injudiciously, expended
them for domestic purposes.</p>

<p>Apart from its rarity, <i>The Death-Wake</i> has an interest of its own for
curious amateurs of poetry. The year of its composition (1830) was the
great year of <i>Romanticisme</i> in France, the year of <i>Hernani</i>, and of
Gautier's <i>gilet rouge</i>. In France it was a literary age  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span> given to
medi&aelig;val extravagance, to the dagger and the bowl, the cloak and
sword, the mad monk and the were-wolf; the age of P&eacute;trus Borel and
MacKeat, as well as of Dumas and Hugo. Now the official poetry of our
country was untouched by and ignorant of the virtues and excesses of
1830. Wordsworth's bolt was practically shot; Sir Walter was ending
his glorious career; Shelley and Byron and Keats were dead, and the
<i>annus mirabilis</i> of Coleridge was long gone by. Three young poets of
the English-speaking race were producing their volumes, destined at
first to temporary neglect. The year 1830 was the year of Mr.
Tennyson's <i>Poems, chiefly Lyrical</i>, his first book, not counting
<i>Poems by Two Brothers</i>. It was also the year of Mr. Browning's
<i>Pauline</i> (rarer even than <i>The Death-Wake</i>); and it was the year
which followed the second, and perhaps the most characteristic,
poetical venture of Edgar Allan Poe. In Mr.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span> Tennyson's early lyrics,
and in Mr. Poe's, any capable judge must have recognised new notes of
romance. Their accents are fresh and strange, their imaginations dwell
in untrodden regions. Untouched by the French romantic poets, they yet
unconsciously reply to their notes, as if some influence in the mental
air were at work on both sides of the Channel, on both sides of the
Atlantic. Now, in my opinion, this indefinite influence was also
making itself felt, faintly and dimly, in Scotland. <i>The Death-Wake</i>
is the work of a lad who certainly had read Keats, Coleridge and
Shelley, but who is no imitator of these great poets. He has, in a few
passages, and at his best, an accent original, distinct, strangely
musical, and really replete with promise. He has a fresh unborrowed
melody and mastery of words, the first indispensable sign of a true
poet. His rhymed heroic verse is no more the rhymed heroic verse of
 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span> <i>Endymion</i>, than it is that of Mr. Pope, or of Mr. William Morris. He
is a new master of the old instrument.</p>

<p>His mood is that of Scott when Scott was young, and was so anxious to
possess a death's head and cross-bones. The malady is "most incident"
to youth, but Mr. Stoddart wears his rue with a difference. The mad
monkish lover of the dead nun Agath&eacute; has hit on precisely the sort of
fantasy which was about to inspire Th&eacute;ophile Gautier's <i>Com&eacute;die de la
Mort</i>, or the later author of <i>Gaspard de la Nuit</i>, or Edgar Poe.
There is here no "criticism of life;" it is a criticism of strange
death; and, so far, may recall Beddoes's <i>Death's Jest-Book</i>,
unpublished, of course, in 1830. Naturally this kind of poetry is
"useless," as Mr. Ruskin says about Coleridge, but, in its <i>bizarre</i>
way, it may be beautiful.</p>

<p>The author, by a curious analogy with Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, was, in these
days, a  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span> humourist as well as a poet. In the midst of his mad fancies
and rare melodies he is laughing at himself, as Th&eacute;ophile mocked at
<i>Les Jeunes France</i>. The psychological position is, therefore, one of
the rarest. Mr. Stoddart was, first of all and before all, a hardy and
enthusiastic angler. Between 1830 and 1840 he wrote a few beautiful
angling songs, and then all the poetry of his character merged itself
in an ardent love of Nature: of hill, loch and stream&mdash;above all, of
Tweed, the fairest of waters, which he lived to see a sink of
pollution. After 1831 we have no more romanticism from Mr. Stoddart.
The wind, blowing where it listeth, struck on him as on an &AElig;olian
harp, and "an uncertain warbling made," in the true Romantic manner.
He did write a piece with the alluring name of <i>Ajalon of the Winds</i>,
but not one line of it survives. The rest is not silence, indeed, for,
in addition to his lays of trout and salmon, of Tweed and Teviot, Mr.
Stoddart wrote a  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span> good deal of prose, and a good deal of perfectly
common and uninspired verse. The Muse, which was undeniably with him
for an hour, abandoned him, or he deserted her, being content to whip
the waters of Tweed, and Meggat, and Yarrow. Perhaps unfavourable and
unappreciative criticism, acting on a healthy and contented nature,
drove him back into the common paths of men. Whatever the cause, the
<i>Death-Wake</i> alone (save for a few angling songs) remains to give
assurance of a poet "who died young." It is needless to rewrite the
biography, excellently done, in <i>Angling Songs</i>, by Miss Stoddart, the
poet's daughter (Blackwoods, Edinburgh, 1889). Mr. Stoddart was born
on St. Valentine's Day 1810, in Argyll Square, Edinburgh, nearly on
the site of the Kirk of Field, where Darnley was murdered. He came of
an old Border family. Miss Stoddart tells a painful tale of an aged
Miss Helen who burned family papers because she  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span> thought she was
bewitched by the seals and decorated initials. Similar follies are
reported of a living old lady, on whose hearth, after a night of
destruction, was once found the impression of a seal of Mary of
Modena. I could give only too good a guess at the <i>provenance</i> of
<i>those</i> papers, but nobody can interfere. Beyond 1500 the family
memories rely on tradition. The ancestors owned lands in the Forest of
Ettrick, and Williamhope, on the Tweed hard by Ashestiel. On the
Glenkinnon burn, celebrated by Scott, they hid the prophets of the
Covenant "by fifties in a cave." One Williamhope is said to have been
out at Drumclog, or, perhaps, Bothwell Brig. This laird, of enormous
strength, was called the Beetle of Yarrow, and was a friend of Murray
of Philiphaugh. His son, in the Fifteen, was out on the Hanoverian
side, which was <i>not</i> in favour with the author of <i>The Death-Wake</i>.
He married a daughter of  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span> Veitch of The Glen, now the property of Sir
Charles Tennant. In the next generation but one, the Stoddarts sold
their lands and took to commerce, while the poet's father won great
distinction in the Navy. The great-great-grandfather of the poet
married a Miss Muir of Anniston, the family called cousins (on which
side of the blanket I know not) with Robert II. of Scotland, and, by
another line, were as near as in the sixth degree of James III.</p>

<p>As a schoolboy, Mr. Stoddart was always rhyming of goblin, ghost,
fairy, and all Sir Walter's themes. At Edinburgh University he was a
pupil of Christopher North (John Wilson), who pooh-poohed <i>The
Death-Wake</i> in <i>Blackwood</i>. He also knew Aytoun, Professor Ferrier, De
Quincey, Hartley Coleridge, and Hogg, and was one of the first guests
of Tibbie Sheils, on the spit of land between St. Mary's and the Loch
of the Lowes. In verses of this period (1827)  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span> Miss Stoddart detects
traces of Keats and Byron, but the lines quoted are much better in
<i>technique</i> than Byron usually wrote.</p>

<p>The summer of 1830 Mr. Stoddart passed in Hogg's company on Yarrow,
and early in 1831 he published <i>The Death-Wake</i>. There is no trace of
James Hogg in the poem, which, to my mind, is perfectly original.
Wilson places it "between the weakest of Shelley and the strongest of
Barry Cornwall." It is really nothing but a breath of the spirit of
romance, touching an instrument not wholly out of tune, but never to
be touched again.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to follow Mr. Stoddart through a long and happy life
of angling and of literary leisure. He only blossomed once. His poem
was plagiarised and inserted in <i>Graham's Magazine</i>, by a person named
Louis Fitzgerald Tasistro (vol. xx.). Mr. Ingram, the biographer of
Edgar Poe, observes that Poe praised the piece while  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span> he was exposing
Tasistro's "barefaced robbery."</p>

<p>The copy of <i>The Death-Wake</i> from which this edition is printed was
once the property of Mr. Aytoun, author of <i>Lays of the Scottish
Cavaliers</i>, and, I presume, of <i>Ta Phairshon</i>. Mr. Aytoun has written
a prefatory sonnet which will be found in its proper place, a set of
rhymes on the flyleaf at the end, and various cheerful but unfeeling
notes. After some hesitation I do not print these frivolities.</p>

<p>The copy was most generously presented to me by Professor Knight of
St. Andrews, and I have only seen one other example, which I in turn
contributed to fill the vacant place in the shelves of Mr. Knight. His
example, however, is far the more curious of the twain, by virtue of
Aytoun's annotations.</p>

<p>I had been wanting to see <i>The Death-Wake</i> ever since, as a boy, I
read the unkind review of it in an ancient volume of <i>Blackwood's
 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span> Magazine</i>. In its "pure purple mantle" of glazed cloth, with paper
label, it is an unaffectedly neat and well-printed little volume.</p>

<p>It would be unbecoming and impertinent to point out to any one who has
an ear for verse, the charm of such lines as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A murmur far and far, of those that stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the great encampment of the sea."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A love-winged seraph glides in glory by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striking the tent of its mortality."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(An idea anticipated by the as yet unknown Omar Khayyam).</p>

<p>Or&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dost thou, in thy vigil, hail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arcturus in his chariot pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leading him with a fiery flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the hollow hill of night?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These are wonderful verses for a lad of twenty-one, living among
anglers,  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span> undergraduates, and, if with some society of the lettered,
apparently with none which could appreciate or applaud him.</p>

<p>For the matter of the poem, the wild voyage of the mad monkish lover
with the dead Bride of Heaven, it strikes, of course, on the common
reef of the Romantic&mdash;the ridiculous. But the recurring contrasts of a
pure, clear peace in sea and sky, are of rare and atoning beauty. Such
a passage is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And the great ocean, like a holy hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where slept a seraph host maritimal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was gorgeous with wings of diamond."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Once more, when the mad monk tells the sea-waves</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That ye have power and passion, and a sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of the flying of an angel round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty world, that ye are one with Time,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we recognise genuine imagination.</p>
<p> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span> </p>

<p>A sympathetic reader of <i>The Death-Wake</i> would perhaps have expected
the leprosies and lunacies to drop off, and the genius, purged of its
accidents, to move into a pure transparency. The abnormal, the
monstrous, the boyish elements should have been burned away in the
fire of the genius of poetry. But the Muses did not so will it, and
the mystic wind of the spirit of song became of less moment to Mr.
Stoddart than the breeze on the loch that stirs the trout to feed.
Perhaps his life was none the less happy and fortunate. Of the many
brilliant men whom he knew intimately&mdash;Wilson, Aytoun, Ferrier,
Glassford Bell, and others&mdash;perhaps none, not even Hogg, recognised
the grace of the Muse which (in my poor opinion) Mr. Stoddart
possessed. His character was not in the least degree soured by neglect
or fretted by banter. Not to over-estimate oneself is a virtue very
rare among poets, and certainly does not lead to public triumphs.
Modesty  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span> is apt to accompany the sense of humour which alleviates
life, while it is an almost insuperable bar to success.</p>

<p>Mr. Stoddart died on November 22nd, 1880. His last walk was to Kelso
Bridge "to look at the Tweed," which now murmurs by his grave the

<span class="i0">And Julio saw him buffeting the throng<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Over him&mdash;a wind-shaken cerement!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">In that wild shipwreck, and he drew it home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With madness, to his bosom: the white foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was o'er its strings; and on the streaming sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wiped them, running, with his fingers pale,<br /></span>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

opportunities to fix the problem.

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
